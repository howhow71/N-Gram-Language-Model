<s> He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books </s>
<s> For three hours we strolled about together , watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet Street and the Strand </s>
<s> The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel </s>
<s> I've always been proud above my station in life , and disgrace would kill me </s>
<s> It was , of course , of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper , otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay </s>
<s> The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now </s>
<s> If he is violent , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow </s>
<s> It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots </s>
<s> Several discs of metal , old coins apparently , such as I hold here , were scattered over the bottom of the box , but it contained nothing else </s>
<s> There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still </s>
<s> He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone </s>
<s> He used to make merry over the cleverness of women , but I have not heard him do it of late </s>
<s> We should not have troubled you , only that our friend who speaks Greek and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the East </s>
<s> It is not a common experience among employers in this age </s>
<s> He sat at my side in silence all the time , and I was aware , more than once when I glanced in his direction , that he was looking at me with great intensity </s>
<s> Major Murphy , to whom I owe most of my facts , assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair </s>
<s> My practice had steadily increased , and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station , I got a few patients from among the officials </s>
<s> They saw that I must know all about it , you see , and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate </s>
<s> All you have to do is just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room </s>
<s> It is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter </s>
<s> Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together , bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village </s>
<s> It is a perfectly overpowering impulse , and I have more than once taken advantage of it </s>
<s> I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you </s>
<s> We are spies in an enemy's country </s>
<s> My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night </s>
<s> It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom , with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner </s>
<s> A collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business </s>
<s> With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he hesitated and then came back </s>
<s> As I ran down the passage , my sister's door was unlocked , and revolved slowly upon its hinges </s>
<s> My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring </s>
<s> You will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants </s>
<s> It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire , and within seven miles of Reading </s>
<s> Still , of course , if you would like to draw out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so </s>
<s> For that matter , Reading , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all </s>
<s> At first I thought that she had not recognised me , but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget , 'Oh , my God </s>
<s> He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened </s>
<s> Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman , obese , pompous , and slow </s>
<s> God help those who wander into the great mire now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass </s>
<s> But , you know , I have been trained as an actress myself </s>
<s> You will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate </s>
<s> Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms , including those of Mr. Cunningham and his son </s>
<s> He went over to the door , and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical way </s>
<s> There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was peeling off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , unhealthy blotches </s>
<s> I rubbed one of them on my sleeve , however , and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand </s>
<s> He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England </s>
<s> I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day </s>
<s> Was he our malignant enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel </s>
<s> He was plainly but neatly dressed , and his age , I should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty </s>
<s> Who were these German people , and what were they doing living in this strange , out-of-the-way place </s>
<s> He was of a sickly color , and his thin , sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion </s>
<s> Rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house , but in vain </s>
<s> I have a few thousands to invest , d'ye see , and I think I'll sink them in you </s>
<s> I was feeling drowsy and stupid , partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work </s>
<s> I rushed madly from the room on to the landing </s>
<s> For all they cared it might have been me , instead of my effigy , which these rascals burned at the stake </s>
<s> The French or the Russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers </s>
<s> The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire </s>
<s> Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar </s>
<s> I had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him , until the merest accident opened my eyes to it </s>
<s> Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock , which boomed out every quarter of an hour </s>
<s> The Colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies </s>
<s> You must lock yourself up from him to-night </s>
<s> Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station </s>
<s> I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives </s>
<s> He would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells , and then would engage her as his accomplice </s>
<s> For days on end , when the mood was on him , he has been sunk in the deepest gloom </s>
<s> The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture </s>
<s> You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one , and laid them along the edge of the table </s>
<s> He came up to my room one morning , and plunged into business in an instant </s>
<s> No sound came from within , and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over </s>
<s> The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day </s>
<s> He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton , and , cautioning me not to speak , he led the way into the hall </s>
<s> Then , again , I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red , or dark red , or anything but real bright , blazing , fiery red </s>
<s> Holmes had brought up a long thin cane , and this he placed upon the bed beside him </s>
<s> She listened for an instant , threw up her hands with a despairing gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come </s>
<s> You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time </s>
<s> The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard , rough surface </s>
<s> Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled </s>
<s> I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children </s>
<s> He's in hiding , too , but he's not a convict as far as I can make out </s>
<s> Again and again I have taken a problem to him , and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one </s>
<s> It was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody </s>
<s> Whatever his crimes , he has suffered something to atone for them </s>
<s> But not one word shall they have from me , and I bind you to secrecy also , Dr. Watson </s>
<s> He has been very attentive to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on </s>
<s> Suddenly , however , an unexpected incident opened up quite a new prospect to me </s>
<s> Then he vanished over the hill </s>
<s> Holmes walked slowly , taking keen note of the architecture of the house </s>
<s> This , of course , fitted in well enough with the police theory , if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him </s>
<s> I want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be explained away </s>
<s> They have given up the chase there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him </s>
<s> He had usually a great many letters , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him </s>
<s> There he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill </s>
<s> The point is a simple one , but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter </s>
<s> I should like to have his opinion of the case , though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done </s>
<s> I rang the bell , therefore , to summon him </s>
<s> He found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided </s>
<s> I put myself in the man's place and , having first gauged his intelligence , I try to imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances </s>
<s> He was a well-grown , handsome man , with a splendid forehead , and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now </s>
<s> At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead , where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes </s>
<s> A Greek friend had come to see him upon business , he said , and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue , the services of an interpreter were indispensable </s>
<s> But he will never trouble anyone in this country again </s>
<s> It was a homely little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old country-houses </s>
<s> Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress </s>
<s> I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table </s>
<s> An instant later I heard him running down , and he burst into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic </s>
<s> It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny , and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion </s>
<s> It was worth an effort to find out , and for that object we all went up to the house </s>
<s> I would never trust a banker , Mr. Holmes </s>
<s> Holmes flung open the door and rushed in , but he was out again in an instant , with his hand to his throat </s>
<s> But I want to find out about them , and who they are , and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me </s>
<s> I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing </s>
<s> My poor friend's face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression </s>
<s> The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us , and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away </s>
<s> The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes </s>
<s> They say that away down in the village , and even in the distant parsonage , that cry raised the sleepers from their beds </s>
<s> Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes </s>
<s> The J. P shrugged his shoulders , and led the way into his own chamber , which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room </s>
<s> The bell-rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk </s>
<s> I know something , Sir Henry , and perhaps I should have said it before , but it was long after the inquest that I found it out </s>
<s> He did burn the letter </s>
<s> One side of the window was open , which I understand was quite usual in the summer-time , and he passed without difficulty into the room </s>
<s> Again and again I cross-questioned her , but I could never get past that point </s>
<s> The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected </s>
<s> We were at breakfast when the Colonel's butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him </s>
<s> There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you </s>
<s> I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart </s>
<s> I slept at Baker Street that night , and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room </s>
<s> My mistress told me that you were likely to call </s>
<s> Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall </s>
<s> There is something in it which fascinates me extremely </s>
<s> My submission pleased him and led him to further confidences </s>
<s> Then he turned the handle and entered , I at his heels , with the cocked pistol in my hand </s>
<s> The chimney is wide , but is barred up by four large staples </s>
<s> During my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations , and hardly ever to his own early life </s>
<s> Altogether there are eight maids , the cook , the butler , two footmen , and a boy </s>
<s> He started me off upon the letter A , and then he left me ; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me </s>
<s> He actually sat crying in an arm-chair , and I could hardly get him to speak coherently </s>
<s> It told how two Englishmen who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end </s>
<s> I went up to the house with the Inspector , and saw all that was to be seen </s>
<s> Then I carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn </s>
<s> Then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes </s>
<s> As we passed it Holmes , to my unutterable astonishment , leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over </s>
<s> My clothes were all sodden with dew , and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb </s>
<s> Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal </s>
<s> An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator </s>
<s> There was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some hardness , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty </s>
<s> I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof </s>
<s> These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property , and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles </s>
<s> It will end in my being conveyed into the house </s>
<s> That is my room at the end of the stairs , and my son's is the one beyond it </s>
<s> His eyes rolled upwards , his features writhed in agony , and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground </s>
<s> I was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced </s>
<s> It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it </s>
<s> Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within </s>
<s> His hands and feet were securely strapped together , and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow </s>
<s> Throwing aside my cigarette , I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , I looked in </s>
<s> Then he tried the various keys in the lock , but without success </s>
<s> The paper over each window was impenetrable to light , and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front </s>
<s> And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me </s>
<s> As I set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it </s>
<s> They were a gang , and a rough one , too </s>
<s> The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods </s>
<s> One of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge </s>
<s> I implored the colonel to let me out , but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries </s>
<s> Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left </s>
<s> But , first , as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room , I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy , Colonel </s>
<s> I caught a glimpse of rushing figures , and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm </s>
<s> Mr. Cunningham , looking out of his bedroom , saw the fellow as he gained the road , but lost sight of him at once </s>
<s> You can hardly realize , then , how difficult I found it at first , and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway </s>
<s> It is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business </s>
<s> I threw myself , screaming , against the door , and dragged with my nails at the lock </s>
<s> I rushed across the bedroom , flung open the window , and looked out </s>
<s> The lady , against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested , was removed to her room , still in a state of insensibility </s>
<s> Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way </s>
<s> He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit </s>
<s> Indeed , it was almost mesmeric , the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist , for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek </s>
<s> Look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting </s>
<s> I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column </s>
<s> I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and clad in some sort of loose white gown </s>
<s> Five little livid spots , the marks of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist </s>
<s> Of course , if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it </s>
<s> Julia went there at Christmas two years ago , and met there a half-pay major of marines , to whom she became engaged </s>
<s> On the third morning , however he did not appear , as was his custom , after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day </s>
<s> The flush had faded in an instant , and a deathly face was before me </s>
<s> Here we dismissed our cab , and made our way up the drive together </s>
<s> I was the only passenger who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern </s>
<s> Suddenly , however , he started , tapped me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows </s>
<s> It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking </s>
<s> I had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was </s>
<s> At two o'clock he bade me good-day , complimented me upon the amount that I had written , and locked the door of the office after me </s>
<s> As we walked home together , Holmes stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several wires </s>
<s> It may stop his gossip </s>
<s> You must not interfere , come what may </s>
<s> I heard a gentle sound of movement , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger </s>
<s> It struck cold to our hearts , and I stood gazing at Holmes , and he at me , until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose </s>
<s> My companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the weapon , I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him </s>
<s> Miss Irene , or Madame , rather , returns from her drive at seven </s>
<s> He was deadly pale and terribly emaciated , with the protruding , brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength </s>
<s> The place we want must be somewhere near that line </s>
<s> These articles , with two small wicker-work chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre </s>
<s> Upon the floor , close to the body , was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle </s>
<s> The more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain </s>
<s> He was thin and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind </s>
<s> Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of </s>
<s> I knew that it was my sister's voice </s>
<s> He took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee </s>
<s> The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection , and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time </s>
<s> I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip , but now I began to wish to hear more of it </s>
<s> I measured out the distance , which brought me almost to the wall of the house , and I thrust a peg into the spot </s>
<s> A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened </s>
<s> My heart leaped within me as I saw it </s>
<s> I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man a man who might play a deep game </s>
<s> There he is , all safe and sound </s>
<s> These walls are thick , and it is conceivable that his shriek , if he had time to utter one , was unheard </s>
<s> Neither address nor date is attached to it </s>
<s> He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post </s>
<s> And , first , one or two questions , Mr. Wilson </s>
<s> My nets are closing upon him , even as his are upon Sir Henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy </s>
<s> As to the photograph , your client may rest in peace </s>
<s> The policeman and I agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she could get rid of the papers , presuming that she had them </s>
<s> He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures </s>
<s> And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest </s>
<s> Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him </s>
<s> The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians </s>
<s> If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised </s>
<s> The Colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa , and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy </s>
<s> The book , however , had been left in the billiard-room , so I pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it </s>
<s> He has died within ten seconds of being bitten </s>
<s> The chamber was certainly large , and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it told me of its richness </s>
<s> I should be compelled to stop the night </s>
<s> He is not a bad fellow , though an absolute imbecile in his profession </s>
<s> I am a dangerous man to fall foul of </s>
<s> Besides this preliminary outlay , he must be prepared to keep himself for some years , and to hire a presentable carriage and horse </s>
<s> Holmes rushed at the bell-pull , tore back a small sliding shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter </s>
<s> A few minutes later we were joined by a short , stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his Southern origin , though his speech was that of an educated Englishman </s>
<s> Well , there is nothing very instructive in all this </s>
<s> The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth </s>
<s> I give you my solemn word upon that </s>
<s> There were two guides given us to start with , an oak and an elm </s>
<s> Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady ; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his face </s>
<s> I could see that she was pretty , and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material </s>
<s> I could only move it slightly , and it was with the aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying it to one side </s>
<s> They had each been stabbed , it seems , and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarreled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other </s>
<s> He'll be cut up over this , for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant </s>
<s> The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton , as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess </s>
<s> It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall </s>
<s> Holmes's voice sank as he answered </s>
<s> Your mission today has justified itself , and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side </s>
<s> And your address had been given me </s>
<s> Then you hand over to me three quarters of what you earn , and you keep the other quarter for yourself </s>
<s> Add to that the length of neck and head , and you get a creature not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail </s>
<s> The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy stick in his hand </s>
<s> His hair and whiskers were shot with gray , and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple </s>
<s> Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern </s>
<s> He appeared to be deformed , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent </s>
<s> It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure , and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part </s>
<s> The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged </s>
<s> Mr. Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man , and so the villain got clean away </s>
<s> When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode </s>
<s> To the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are , and to underestimate one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers </s>
<s> There is no communication between them , but they all open out into the same corridor </s>
<s> For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction , but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor </s>
<s> Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated </s>
<s> She married an artist named Lyons , who came sketching on the moor </s>
<s> She knocked without receiving any answer , and even turned the handle , but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside </s>
<s> As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape </s>
<s> You must find your own ink , pens , and blotting-paper , but we provide this table and chair </s>
<s> I should like , however , to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do </s>
<s> Not a whisper , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped </s>
<s> And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest </s>
<s> I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind </s>
<s> Mr. Alec , however , was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with </s>
<s> The point under discussion was , how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his ancestry and how far to his own early training </s>
<s> I don't think I ever drove faster , but the others were there before us </s>
<s> We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field , his chin sunk upon his breast , and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets </s>
<s> While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer , who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him </s>
<s> You , of course , saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice </s>
<s> He was off like a shot and got clean away </s>
<s> In two hours we must be on the scene of action </s>
<s> I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements </s>
<s> His heart was weak , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision </s>
<s> I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite secure , and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves 'Hullo' I yelled 'Hullo </s>
<s> There are many men in London , you know , who , some from shyness , some from misanthropy , have no wish for the company of their fellows </s>
<s> In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was partly caved in , a picture of ruin </s>
<s> It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected </s>
<s> It was a quiet , little , plainly furnished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several German books were scattered </s>
<s> He had a very dark , fearsome face , and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams </s>
<s> He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand </s>
<s> In the last century , however , four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency </s>
<s> Two hansoms were standing at the door , and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above </s>
<s> On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was ajar </s>
<s> I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell </s>
<s> I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before , for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late </s>
<s> Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well </s>
<s> Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment </s>
<s> It threw a livid , unnatural circle upon the floor , while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall </s>
<s> The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty </s>
<s> Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed , and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown </s>
<s> Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open </s>
<s> A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him </s>
<s> In normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence </s>
<s> But the girl held true to me , and it seemed that I would have had her when the Mutiny broke out , and all hell was loose in the country </s>
<s> On the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also </s>
<s> Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night </s>
<s> Now , of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms </s>
<s> I thought the matter over , and I came to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes's prophecy was soon fulfilled , and in a dramatic fashion </s>
<s> The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms </s>
<s> A young man , very pale and worn , was lying upon a sofa near the open window , through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air </s>
<s> There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it </s>
<s> The manor-house is , as I have already said , very old , and only one wing is now inhabited </s>
<s> Yet , with all this , you made me reveal what you wanted to know </s>
<s> This second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door , used by servants , and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street </s>
<s> I really had not the energy to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion , but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation </s>
<s> A low moan had fallen upon our ears </s>
<s> If my hair would only change colour , here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into </s>
<s> As to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to , at the time which suits you best </s>
<s> She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime </s>
<s> Now , on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open </s>
<s> From this he took a paper , and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table , and began to study it with minute attention </s>
<s> We hired a hansom , and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us </s>
<s> I tried to puzzle it out , but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation </s>
<s> Matters were in this state , when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery </s>
<s> The unknown might be lurking there , or he might be prowling on the moor </s>
<s> Thrust it into his pocket , most likely , never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse </s>
<s> For years I've been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of England </s>
<s> As it is , I feel that young man's grip on my throat now , and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand </s>
<s> It is most refreshingly unusual </s>
<s> But sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned </s>
<s> It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in , and the lock forced back with it </s>
<s> If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first , leaving blanks for the other to fill up </s>
<s> I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me </s>
<s> The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy </s>
<s> The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor </s>
<s> His clothes , his watch , and even his money were in his room , but the black suit which he usually wore was missing </s>
<s> In order to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter , and they pitch upon this Mr. Melas , having used some other one before </s>
<s> I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket </s>
<s> A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight , and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it </s>
<s> I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head </s>
<s> I noticed her pass , but I had no special reason for watching her </s>
<s> Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water </s>
<s> I shall call with the King to-morrow , and with you , if you care to come with us </s>
<s> Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession </s>
<s> A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me </s>
<s> The lawn is thirty yards across , and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it </s>
<s> All day today the rain poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves </s>
<s> His secret was a shameful one , and he could not bring himself to divulge it </s>
<s> Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him , but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him </s>
<s> I had no difficulty in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed </s>
<s> Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room </s>
<s> When a woman thinks that her house is on fire , her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most </s>
<s> There was a chair just under the lamp , and the elderly man motioned that I should sit in it </s>
<s> I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay , and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession </s>
<s> We could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in </s>
<s> There is no possibility of a secret door , and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground </s>
<s> For God's sake , sir , I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor </s>
<s> A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me </s>
<s> You can imagine my exultation , Watson , when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground </s>
<s> The lamps had been lit , but the blinds had not been drawn , so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch </s>
<s> I am a light sleeper , and it has awakened me </s>
<s> In an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place , and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently </s>
<s> The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness </s>
<s> Already I was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart </s>
<s> It swelled up louder and louder , a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek </s>
<s> The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room </s>
<s> I have told you now the whole truth , and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend stood </s>
<s> Have your pistol ready in case we should need it </s>
<s> He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest , and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid , such as children's toys are kept in </s>
<s> During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad named Percy Phelps , who was of much the same age as myself , though he was two classes ahead of me </s>
<s> I read death on his face as plain as I can read that text over the fire </s>
<s> Suddenly , as I looked , he rose from his chair , and walking over to a bureau at the side , he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers </s>
<s> Fresh scandals have eclipsed it , and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama </s>
<s> It might or might not bite the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim </s>
<s> Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported </s>
<s> He has nerve and he has knowledge </s>
<s> The instant that we heard it , Holmes sprang from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull </s>
<s> I have already arranged what is to occur </s>
<s> And Holmes' fears came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister German , or the morose Englishman </s>
<s> I can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chimes from a neighboring clock </s>
<s> I should not wish a smarter assistant , Mr. Holmes ; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him </s>
<s> With much labour we separated them and carried him , living but horribly mangled , into the house </s>
<s> He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes </s>
<s> He may have been asleep , or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out </s>
<s> No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted </s>
<s> When you raise your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a number of people </s>
<s> The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us </s>
<s> When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband , and to assure him that she would be back before very long </s>
<s> Nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overhead </s>
<s> The carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind </s>
<s> The proceedings against the page broke down for want of evidence , and the Brook Street Mystery , as it was called , has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print </s>
<s> The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat </s>
<s> I shall stand behind this crate , and do you conceal yourselves behind those </s>
<s> The letter had , as I said , been burned and it was not all legible </s>
<s> But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light </s>
<s> I paid the man and hurried into the church </s>
<s> I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit , understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself </s>
<s> He came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with an intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused </s>
<s> Such an excursion could not be kept secret </s>
<s> I fainted when it was done , and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time </s>
<s> Then he threw himself down into the chair opposite , and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long , thin shins </s>
<s> The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate </s>
<s> It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London , and the fittings , though frayed , were of rich quality </s>
<s> I had let myself go , and was hanging by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell </s>
<s> Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings </s>
<s> One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart , the housemaid </s>
<s> Evidently , therefore , Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired </s>
<s> Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission </s>
<s> I should like , for example , to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front </s>
<s> I thought that she had fainted , but she recovered herself by a supreme effort </s>
<s> Holmes waved away the compliment , though his smile showed that it had pleased him </s>
<s> They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard , those of Barclay and of his wife </s>
<s> A coachman and two maids form the staff of servants </s>
<s> My attention was speedily drawn , as I have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed </s>
<s> That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins </s>
<s> I had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed </s>
<s> We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning </s>
<s> Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug </s>
<s> Suddenly , however , as I ran , a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me </s>
<s> He had ceased to moan as we laid him down , and a glance showed me that for him at least our aid had come too late </s>
<s> By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle </s>
<s> Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man , but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman </s>
<s> I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people </s>
<s> In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears </s>
<s> I keep it only to safeguard myself , and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future </s>
<s> Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs </s>
<s> He was unable , however , to make his way in , and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him </s>
<s> The other was a very small , dark fellow , with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm </s>
<s> What is the meaning of it all </s>
<s> We had a small scene this morning after breakfast </s>
<s> I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair </s>
<s> It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession </s>
<s> Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man , who was still sleeping soundly , when a bell over his head rang loudly , and he woke with a start </s>
<s> It appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet </s>
<s> Between ourselves , I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his illness yet </s>
<s> I was conscious of a dull pain , my grip loosened , and I fell into the garden below </s>
<s> Nothing had been touched or taken , but there were the footprints to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact </s>
<s> Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's , and , having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times , he went up to the door and knocked </s>
<s> He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels </s>
<s> We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France </s>
<s> I came away baffled and disheartened </s>
<s> The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown , worm-eaten oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house </s>
<s> Let me pass , I say' He dashed her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon </s>
<s> It was a wonderfully silent house </s>
<s> I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery </s>
<s> A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket </s>
<s> I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man </s>
<s> He was a dashing , jovial old soldier in his usual mood , but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness </s>
<s> A terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor </s>
<s> He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day </s>
<s> I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel </s>
<s> We all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative </s>
<s> There is a comfortable sofa </s>
<s> So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway , and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side </s>
<s> The back door was open , and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside </s>
<s> A maid rushed across and threw open the window </s>
<s> It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west </s>
<s> I was instantly aroused , and , with the two footmen , started off at once in search of the missing girl </s>
<s> So far I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen them </s>
<s> One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic </s>
<s> A ventilator is made , a cord is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies </s>
<s> He was tractable enough , though his son was a perfect demon , ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver </s>
<s> On reaching Scotland Yard , however , it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house </s>
<s> It was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him , and yet where could he be </s>
<s> The bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room </s>
<s> All my unspoken instincts , my vague suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist </s>
<s> I have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness , and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being at work </s>
<s> It was several miles off , but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray </s>
<s> We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa , and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife , I did what I could to relieve his pain </s>
<s> But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards </s>
<s> Admiration was , I repeat , the first impression </s>
<s> Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night , and has not been heard of since </s>
<s> At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me , and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect </s>
<s> He is a bit of a Don Juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district </s>
<s> What is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante </s>
<s> Twelve struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall </s>
<s> Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of voices raised , and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion </s>
<s> I tapped upon the floor , but it sounded the same all over , and there was no sign of any crack or crevice </s>
<s> Within there was a small corridor , which ended in a very massive iron gate </s>
<s> I made no allusion to what had passed , and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace </s>
<s> For a moment or two I sat breathless , hardly able to believe my ears </s>
<s> But a singular interruption brought us to a standstill </s>
<s> Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly </s>
<s> Then , when I flash a light upon them , close in swiftly </s>
<s> It is evident , therefore , that if both girls had married , this beauty would have had a mere pittance , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent </s>
<s> I am sorry to have interrupted you </s>
<s> Her face fell , however , when she saw that I was a stranger , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit </s>
<s> We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound , and then a scream of agony , with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to </s>
<s> Sorry to see that you've had the British workman in the house </s>
<s> Even after I became suspicious , I found it hard to think evil of such a dear , kind old clergyman </s>
<s> His life was irregular , but in one respect he was regularity itself </s>
<s> He was all right , as far as money went , but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin </s>
<s> Then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul </s>
<s> Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day </s>
<s> The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory , so leaving my patient seated in his chair , I ran down to get it </s>
<s> Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction </s>
<s> It was a perfect day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens </s>
<s> I fastened the rod on end , marked out the direction of the shadow , and measured it </s>
<s> An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door </s>
<s> The lash , however , was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord </s>
<s> About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House </s>
<s> Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me </s>
<s> I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South America </s>
<s> We had reached Pall Mall as we talked , and were walking down it from the St. James's end </s>
<s> He had started running swiftly over the moor , and I had followed at his heels </s>
<s> Then I walked across to the window , hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side , but an oak shutter , heavily barred , was folded across it </s>
<s> But the evening has brought a breeze with it </s>
<s> I am only , of course , giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper </s>
<s> My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end </s>
<s> I should not go too far if I were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me </s>
<s> Suddenly , amid all the hubbub of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman </s>
<s> To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged </s>
<s> An hour and half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone </s>
<s> I will never so much as breathe the same air with you again </s>
<s> When he raised his face again , I was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with color , and his eyes as bright as before his illness </s>
<s> The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed </s>
